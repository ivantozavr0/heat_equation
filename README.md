    In this project the heat equation with constant coefficients is solved. This script was needed to solve one of the tasks for my scientific work. In my task the cover glass of the solar panels of the K-208 spacecraft is exposed to electron radiation with an energy of 30 keV and flux density of (10E+12 s^-1 cm^-2), which corresponds to the energies of electrons in the hot magnetospheric plasma of the Earth. The energy losses of electrons inside the glass were obtained and calculated using the Geant4 software package.
